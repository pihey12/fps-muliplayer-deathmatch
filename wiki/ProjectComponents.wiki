#summary Break down of the phases and components of the project.

= Phase 1 =

*Menu*

Joining a Room
 - Dale
 You will also need  to add some form of login screen or have the ability to select LAN or internet games. Think I have that documented. What matters is if the user picks internet, we need to have them login.

Creating Room
 - Stephen

Settings (tabs for video, sound, and whatever else is probably needed)
 - Eric

Character Creation - This will be simple but should allow everyone to get a look of the graphics I am considering.
 - Chris

= Phase 2 =
